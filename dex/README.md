# eyeSight Data Exchange Examples (DEX)

The Data Exchange Plugin lets the Forescout platform use the following methods to
communicate with external entities:

* **SQL®, Oracle®, and LDAP servers**: The Forescout platform queries (pull) and
updates (push).

* **Web services**: The Forescout platform queries external services and receives
updates via the eyeSight web service hosted by Data Exchange.
